# DSL methods for AXElements.
#
# The DSL for AXElements is designed to pull actions out from an object
# and put them in front of object to make communicating test steps seem
# more like human instructions.
#
# You can read more about the DSL in the
# [Acting](http://github.com/Marketcircle/AXElements/wiki/Acting)
# section of the AXElements wiki.
